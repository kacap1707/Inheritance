# Inheritance

Here are some good examples explaining the process of inheritance in C#.

In #FinancialOrganizations folder you'll see a basic FinancialInstitution class which will "give birth" to `Bank`s, `Credit organization`s and `Insurance company`ies.
All those institutions inherite all fields, properties and methods from base class. Meanwhile, they also add their own specific states and functionalities.

For example:  
```javascript
public long Assets { get; set; }
public long Liabilities { get; set; } 
```
these properties are particular for Banks, so we add them in derived class(Bank).

The same logic applys to # ThreeDimensionalForms library.
`Ellipsoid` and `Parallelepiped` are derived from base `ThreeDShape` class. This library allows you to create ellipsoid and parallelepiped objects and count their respective `Volumes` and outer `Surfaces`:
```cs
            var piped = new Parallelepiped(5.5,10,3.2,45,45);                 // for parallelepiped
            Console.WriteLine($"Parapippo volume: {piped.Volume}");
            Console.WriteLine($"Paraesiminch surface: {piped.Surface}");
            
            var ellispe = new Ellipsoid(1.5,10,3.6);                          // for ellipsoid
            Console.WriteLine($"Ellipsoid volume: {ellispe.Volume}");
            Console.WriteLine($"Ellipsoid surface: {ellispe.Surface}");
```


In TestingPolygon, the client adds our class library reference in his/her project and employs.
